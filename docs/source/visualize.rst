Visually comparing genome-scale metabolic models
*************************************************

Visualizing the components of each input model with different colors can help compare and visually identify the
components that are common between all models or unique to a single model. The large size of genome-scale metabolic
models makes it more challenging to visualize such relationships.

`Fluxer <https://fluxer.umbc.edu>`_ is a user-friendly web-application that can visualize genome-scale metabolic models
using various graphs and layouts. We have made mergem available on Fluxer so that users can merge models while also
visualizing their components. The Fluxer interface can be used to interact with the merged model, simulate knockouts
in the merged model and even download the final metabolic model (in SBML and graphML formats) and its graphs
(in PNG and SVG formats).

The Fluxer `tutorial page <https://fluxer.umbc.edu/tutorial>`_ provides details on how to merge models on Fluxer, how
to interpret the results and customize the networks generated.
